Guy! Especially Assif, here is the link that will explain how to connect Java to the database. It talks about Hibernate ORM (Object Relational Mapping) and JPA which I think is what we are going to need for this project. 

The website has been rebuilt by Asif and the old files have been moved to the folder marked OLD for convenience. These files will be removed later when they are deemed unnecessary.
